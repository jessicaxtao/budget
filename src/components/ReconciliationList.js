/**
 * Every account, what it holds, and when it was last checked against a
 * statement.
 *
 * The balance beside it is derived — opening plus every transaction through the
 * account — and the reconciliation date is the only thing here that is not. That
 * is exactly why the two belong on one row: the derived figure is only worth
 * trusting as far as the last day someone confirmed it matched the bank, and a
 * balance with no date beside it invites more confidence than the books have
 * earned.
 *
 * The caller hands this only the accounts the budget spends through — an
 * off-budget holding is reconciled from the Net worth page instead, where its
 * balance is actually used.
 *
 * **Two controls, because there are two sizes of answer.** Most months the
 * statement simply agrees, and `ReconcileModal` makes that cost a press to open
 * and a press to confirm a figure nobody needed to change — so "Accurate" is
 * the whole of that act in one click, and the dialog is kept for the day the two
 * disagree and the difference has to be settled.
 *
 * **It is a check for today, not a box that stays ticked.** What is stored is
 * the day the books and the bank were last found to agree, and the act is
 * saying so about today — so the control is a button that records it, and goes
 * quiet once today is what is on file. A checkbox said something different and
 * neither half of it was true: it stood ticked for a month after a check, as
 * though the state were still being asserted, and unticking it *erased* the
 * date rather than taking the day back, so the one row the user least wanted to
 * disturb was one stray click from reading "Never". Whether an account is
 * overdue is a reading of that date, which the row and the header already give
 * — in the date's tone and in "N need checking" — and a control has no business
 * being a third voice on it.
