/**
 * Every movement of money, in one ledger.
 *
 * Income and expenses used to be two stores — `income` in a context of its own
 * and `expenses` inside BudgetsContext — which meant two forms, two lists, and
 * two record shapes describing the same event: money moved, on a date, through
 * an account. They are one store now, discriminated by `kind`.
 *
 * A record is:
 *
 *   { id, kind, date, payeeId, description, amountCents, accountId, toAccountId,
 *     budgetId, splits }
 *
 * **`payeeId` names who the money went to, and `description` is the note beside
 * it.** The two were one field for the whole of this store's life — free text
 * labelled "Paid to" on the form — which is the shape a payee cannot be
 * corrected, counted or reasoned about in. `PayeesContext` owns the records; what
 * is here is the reference, and it is an **id** so that renaming a shop is one
 * write rather than one write per row that names it.
 *
 * `payeeId` is nullable and **no rule requires it**. A cash withdrawal has no
 * payee, a transfer between the household's own accounts has none by
 * construction, and every record written before this field existed has none
 * either. See the note on `RULES` for why its existence is not checked here.
 *
 * `amountCents` is a non-negative magnitude and `kind` carries the direction,
 * rather than a signed amount. Money that moves in two directions through one
 * signed field invites every sign bug there is; the direction is a field of its
 * own, and the amount is always the size of the movement.
 *
 * **There are three kinds, and the third names two accounts.** A `transfer` moves
 * money between the household's own accounts: `accountId` is where it left and
 * `toAccountId` is where it arrived, which is the same "direction is a field"
 * rule one step further on. It is **one record and not a linked pair** — a pair
 * would need every mutator to keep two rows in step on the amount, the date and
 * the description, and a single leg left orphaned by a missed cascade would
 * create or destroy money in a ledger whose one invariant is that the sums cover
 * every row. One record cannot disagree with itself. What a transfer means to the
 * budget is `budgetLegs`'s business, below.
 *
 * **One movement of money may be divided between categories.** `splits` is
 * either null — the ordinary record, filed under the one `budgetId` beside it —
 * or a list of two or more `{ id, budgetId, amountCents }` parts whose amounts
 * add up to `amountCents` exactly. A supermarket run is groceries and a light
 * bulb and a birthday card, and filing the whole receipt under one of the three
 * is the oldest reason a household stops trusting its own categories.
 *
 * **It is parts on the one record, not a parent and its children.** The same
 * choice a transfer makes, for a sharper version of the same reason: the
 * ledger's one invariant is that the sums cover every row, and two rows that can
 * be edited apart will eventually disagree about the amount, the date or the
 * account — at which point the division either creates or destroys money. Here
 * the whole is a field and the parts are a field, so the rule that binds them is
 * something this store can simply check. `sum(parts) === amountCents` is enforced
 * in `RULES` below, and it is what lets the balance sheet go on reading
 * `amountCents` while the envelopes read the parts, with no way for the two to
 * disagree about how much money moved.
 *
 * A part names a category and carries a positive amount — there is no part with
 * no category, because money left unfiled inside a split would be
 * indistinguishable from a smaller transaction, and no negative part, because a
 * discount is a smaller figure rather than money coming back. While a record is
 * split its own `budgetId` is **inert but kept**, the rule a switched-away-from
 * `toAccountId` follows: it is what the record falls back to when the split is
 * undone.
 *
 * **An outflow must name a category. An inflow may.** An inflow with no category
 * is income — it lands in the pool as money to assign. An inflow *with* one is a
 * refund against that category: the friend paying back their half of dinner, the
 * returned jacket, the reimbursed fare. It never reaches the pool, because that
 * money was already assigned once when it went out; it goes back where it came
 * from, and the category's activity for the month is the net of the two. Spend
 * $100 on food and be paid back $60 and food shows $40 of activity, which is what
 * the household actually spent on food.
 *
 * **Every new record names an account.** Refused at this boundary rather than in
 * the form, because this is the edge every caller crosses, and money has to come
 * from somewhere for an account balance to mean anything. `accountId: null` and
 * the Uncategorized sentinel still *read* fine: legacy records have no account,
 * and deleting a category hands its transactions to Uncategorized. What cannot
 * happen is writing a new one that way.
 *
 * **A record can be corrected in place.** `updateTransaction` takes a patch of
 * whatever fields moved and checks the rules those fields could break, so the
 * register can commit one cell at a time and a row folded in from the old
 * stores — no date, no account — can still have its description fixed without
 * being asked to invent the rest. See `RULES` and `firstBroken`.

/**
 * How one record enters the budget's arithmetic: a **list** of legs, each
 * `{ kind, budgetId, amountCents }`, and an empty list for a record the budget
 * never sees.
 *
 * A list rather than a single leg because one movement of money can be divided
 * between categories. An unsplit record is one leg and this is the identity
 * function over its three fields; a split one is a leg per part, and those add
 * up to the whole because the store refuses a split where they do not. Every
 * consumer walks the list, so nothing downstream has to know which shape it was
 * handed.
 *
 * A **transfer** is the other reason this exists: whether it touches the budget
 * at all depends on which side of the boundary each of its two accounts sits, and
 * nothing else.
 *
 *   spends through -> spends through   none      <- a card payment, checking -> savings
 *   spends through -> off budget       outflow   <- a 401(k) contribution
 *   off budget     -> spends through   income    <- a withdrawal into checking
 *   off budget     -> off budget       none      <- a rollover
 *
 * Paying a credit card costs the budget nothing, because the money was already
 * budgeted on its way out through the card; what changes is which account holds
 * it, and both of those are accounts the budget spends through, so on-budget cash
 * is unmoved. Crossing *out* of the budget is real spending and is the shape the
 * app already had before transfers existed — an outflow filed under a savings or
 * retirement category — so it keeps counting exactly that way, and what is new is
 * only that the holding on the far side is credited too. Crossing *in* is new
 * money to assign, for the same reason a paycheque is.
 *
 * **Money arriving from outside the budget ignores any split on the record**, and
 * it is the one place a division is not read. Such a transfer is income to the
 * pool, and there are no categories in the pool — a split says where money
 * *went*, which is exactly what money arriving has not done yet. Inert rather
 * than refused, on the rule this store already keeps for a `toAccountId` left on
 * a record that has stopped being a transfer: re-point it and the division means
 * something again.
 *
 * **One list, and every consumer reads the same one**, which is what keeps the
 * envelope identity true: `useEnvelopes` builds both the pool and the cash-on-hand
 * side of the identity out of this, so neither a transfer nor a split can be
 * counted on one side and missed on the other. `budgetId` is passed through
 * untouched — callers keep their own `?? UNCATEGORIZED_BUDGET_ID` fallback, which
 * is what a crossing transfer with no category stored on it lands on.
 *
 * `insideBudget` comes from `AccountsContext` and is taken as an argument rather
 * than imported: this store sits *above* the account store so that deleting an
 * account can detach its transactions, so it cannot read account scopes itself.
 * That is also why the matrix is not checked in `RULES` — see the note there.

 * whole one and checks all of it. `updateTransaction` changes a field or two of
 * a record that already exists, and checks only the rules those fields could
 * break — which is why each rule names the fields it is about.
 *
 * The last four are cross-field: an outflow names a category *or* is divided

 *
 * **The transfer matrix is deliberately not here.** Whether a transfer needs a

 * this store cannot see an account's scope — it is mounted *above* the account
 * store so that deleting an account can detach its transactions. So the rule is
 * kept where the facts are in hand, exactly as the "no more than the gift itself"
 * bound is for a donation: `AddTransactionModal` refuses to submit a
 * boundary-crossing transfer without a category, and `budgetLegs`'s consumers fall
 * back to `UNCATEGORIZED_BUDGET_ID` for anything that reaches storage without one
 * — the same landing place an orphaned `budgetId` already has, and the reason the
 * envelope identity holds whatever is in the file.
 *
 * **There is no rule about `payeeId` either, for both of those reasons at once.**
 * This store cannot check that a payee exists — `PayeesProvider` is mounted
 * *inside* it so that deleting a payee can detach these rows, which is the same
 * arrangement `AccountsProvider` has and the same reason the matrix above is
 * absent. And a payee is not required in the first place: a cash withdrawal has
 * none, a transfer between the household's own accounts has none, and every
 * record written before the field existed has none. Requiring one would refuse
 * edits to rows that were complete before, which is precisely what
